# Distributed Tracing
## Lesson 4

This lesson is probably the most complicated one. We are going to instrument our
application using OpenTracing, a "standard" set of libraries to build a trace
across all your application.

There are libraries in many languages and luckily for all the application we
have!

During `lesson3-influxdb` one of the application we started with
`docker-compose` was Jaeger. Our distributed tracer.

So we are ready to start instrumenting our favourite application.

### Exercise: Trace applications using OpenTracing and Jager

**Time: 30 minutes**

These are the libraries to use across the languages, open them, follow the
documentation and we should try to figure out how to get an propagate a
trace across all the languages

### Tips and tricks

* To take the most from this exercise we need to have our trace propagated (or
  coming from) the other application. So the first things you can do if to
  `cherry-pick` from the `shopmany` repository the commit related to the other
  application (we saw how to it previously). In this way you will have already a
  working example from other applications to look at.
* If you are working on `item` in `PHP` the problem here is that you will need
  to install new php extenstions via Docker. You need to modify the
  `./item/Dockerfile` and the combination of commands I use to download the
  dependencies is `docker-compose up --build item` and `docker-compose exec item
  composer up` (you need to modify the Dockerfile also to download Composer).
