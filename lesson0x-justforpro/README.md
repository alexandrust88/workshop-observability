# Just for Pro
## Lesson 5

As you can see the lesson05 doesn't have solution and this is just for pro!
I put this together because I hope somebody will have time at home or during the
workshop if it is running ahead of schedule to take this challange.

I never run ahead of schedule, that's why I do not have a solution file for this
lesson! We are gonna get over this together.

### Exercise: Connect the dots!

My dream is implement this roles across the applications:

1. All of the should return an header `X-Trace-ID` with the traceID.
2. As you know every span has a SpanContext that is contains a set of k/v
   propagated between application. They are usually good to pass `user_id` or
   other information that makes the context of the request clear. I would like
   to have these set of values printed out by the logger for every message. With
   the `trace_id` too.

### Motivation

As we know the secret for true happiness is aggregation. We need to be good at
connecting and exposing traces, events and metrics. This exercise is all about
that.
